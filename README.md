# Wind-Turbine-Blade-Analytics
This repository presents a data-driven analysis of structural loads in a wind turbine, focusing on blade root moments, tower bending, and fatigue behavior.
The work explores how physics, control, and environmental factors interact to shape the turbine’s structural response under real operating conditions.

Analyses include:

Descriptive statistics (mean, RMS, standard deviation) of blade root loads

Frequency-domain (PSD) analysis to identify dominant load frequencies

Gust detection through sliding-window derivatives of wind and load signals

Fatigue analysis using rainflow counting and Miner’s rule

The project demonstrates how engineering principles and data analytics combine to support condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and structural health assessment of wind turbine systems.
